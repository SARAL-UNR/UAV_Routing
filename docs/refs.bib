 abstract = {Driven by new laws and regulations concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, carriers are starting to use electric vehicles for last-mile deliveries. The limited battery capacities of these vehicles necessitate visits to recharging stations during delivery tours of industry-typical length, which have to be considered in the route planning to avoid inefficient vehicle routes with long detours. We introduce the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (E-VRPTW), which incorporates the possibility of recharging at any of the available stations using an appropriate recharging scheme. Furthermore, we consider limited vehicle freight capacities as well as customer time windows, which are the most important constraints in real-world logistics applications. As a solution method, we present a hybrid heuristic that combines a variable neighborhood search algorithm with a tabu search heuristic. Tests performed on newly designed instances for the E-VRPTW as well as on benchmark instances of related problems demonstrate the high performance of the heuristic proposed as well as the positive effect of the hybridization.},

  abstract={We consider a multiple depot, multiple vehicle routing problem with fuel constraints. We are given a set of targets, a set of depots and a set of homogeneous vehicles, one for each depot. The depots are also allowed to act as refueling stations. The vehicles are allowed to refuel at any depot, and our objective is to determine a route for each vehicle with a minimum total cost such that each target is visited at least once by some vehicle, and the vehicles never run out fuel as it traverses its route. We refer to this problem as the Multiple Depot, Fuel-Constrained, Multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (FCMVRP). This paper presents four new mixed integer linear programming formulations to compute an optimal solution for the problem. Extensive computational results for a large set of instances are also presented.},

  abstract={Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) need multiple refuels to accomplish large area coverage. We propose the use of a mobile ground vehicle (GV), constrained to travel on a given road network, as a refueling station for the UAV. Determining optimal routes for a UAV and GV, and selecting rendezvous locations for refueling to minimize coverage time is NP-hard. We develop a two-stage strategy for coupled route planning for UAV and GV to perform a coverage mission. The first-stage computes refueling sites that ensure reachability of all points of interest by the UAV and feasible routes for both the UAV and GV. In the second stage, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based exact methods are developed to plan optimal routes for the UAV and GV. As the problem is NP-Hard, we also develop computationally efficient heuristics that can find good feasible solutions within a given time limit. Extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of the developed approaches. Field experiments are also performed to verify the performance of the UAV-GV solution.},

  abstract={We consider a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) routing problem where there are multiple depots and the vehicle is allowed to refuel at any depot. The objective of the problem is to find a path for the UAV such that each target is visited at least once by the vehicle, the fuel constraint is never violated along the path for the UAV, and the total fuel required by the UAV is a minimum. We develop an approximation algorithm for the problem, and propose fast construction and improvement heuristics to solve the same. Computational results show that solutions whose costs are on an average within 1.4% of the optimum can be obtained relatively fast for the problem involving five depots and 25 targets.},
